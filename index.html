    <h2>Light Table musings</h2>
    <p class="lead"><a href="http://lighttable.com/">Light Table</a> is a great editor (plain text or programmers, whichever you prefer), which can be upgraded to IDE by plugins.</p>
<p>
If I want to compare it with some other software application, Firefox first comes to mind, because Firefox is great browser,
but <b>the thing</b> that makes Firefox great are not it's default settings or capabilities, except one - it's extensible.

Someone could say that stands true also for lot of other software products, but when you have exceptional product and it is extensible, then that's something. Similar is true for GNU Emacs, Photoshop and GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program).<br><br>

Here are my advices what plugins you could install to make Light Table good (possibly great) Python editor:

</p><br>

    Plugins:<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Python <span style="color:gray">(installed by default)</span> - core Light Table is language agnostic, plugins for Python, Clojure, HTML, CSS and few more are installed by default</li>
        <li>Reminisce - by default Light Table does not remember your session (you had 5 open files when you closed Light Table, when you open it again - nothing is open) which kinda sucks, but there is plugin that corrects this unusual behavior for editor</li>
        <li>Whitespace - by default Light Table does not differentiate between spaces and tabs (show both just as blank space), and seeing the difference can be very useful in Python if you need to edit somebody elses program.</li>
    </ul><br>
    Settings:<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="user.behaviors.html">user.behaviors.html</a></li>
        <!--<li><a href="">user.keymap.html</a></li> -->
    </ul>
